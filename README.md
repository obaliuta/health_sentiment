# About Dataset
We collected over 10,087 posts from cancer patients and their caregivers on platforms like Reddit, Daily Strength, and the Health Board. The posts were related to five types of cancer: brain, colon, liver, leukemia, and lung cancer. Two team members scored each post based on the emotions expressed, using a scale from -2 to 1. Negative scores (-1 or -2) were given for posts showing grief or suffering, positive scores (1) for happy emotions like relief or accomplishment, and posts with no emotion received a score of 0 and were considered neutral. This analysis aims to understand the emotional aspects of cancer patients posts for a mental health study.
